# CRUD Operations with Express and JavaScript

This repository contains a simple example of implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js with Express on the server-side and JavaScript on the client-side.

## Features

- **Create (POST):** Add new users to the database.
- **Read (GET):** Retrieve all users or a single user from the database.
- **Update (PATCH):** Update existing user data in the database.
- **Delete (DELETE):** Remove users from the database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd crud-express-js
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the Express server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

5. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to interact with the CRUD operations interface.

## Usage

- **Create (POST):** Fill in the user details (ID, Name, Branch) and click the "Insert" button.
- **Read (GET):** Click the "Fetch Data" button to retrieve all users from the database.
- **Update (PATCH):** Click the "Update" button next to a user's entry, enter the new value for the selected field (Name or Branch), and click "OK".
